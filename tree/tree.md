### Example of Trees

examples:

- biology classification tree
- file system
- web page

Properties:

- The first property is that trees are hierarchical. 
- A second property of trees is that all of the children of one node are independent of the children of another node.
- A third property is that each leaf node is unique. 
- Another important property of trees, derived from their hierarchical nature, is that you can move entire sections of a tree (called a subtree) to a different position in the tree without affecting the lower levels of the hierarchy.
